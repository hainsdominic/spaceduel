## Space Duel

The base of the game code is from a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO6qQDNa2UY&t=882s) that I used to learn the PyGame library. I added functionality such as windows and menus. I also created the AI of the opposite player.

If I had to redo this project from scratch, I would use OOP and have classes for the game, the players and the bullets.
